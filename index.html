              <strong>Airflow Through an RC Aircraft</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="description">
              Calculating airflow velocity is crucial for assessing the
              performance of remote-controlled (RC) aircraft. The process begins
              with creating a detailed 3D model of the aircraft, capturing its
              shape and aerodynamic features. Ansys Computational Fluid Dynamics
              (CFD) module is then utilized to simulate the airflow around the
              aircraft. This simulation incorporates variables such as air
              density, pressure, and temperature, which influence velocity
              distribution. Boundary conditions are set to replicate real-world
              operating conditions and environmental factors impacting the
              aircraft. Ansys solves the Navier-Stokes equations iteratively,
              predicting airflow patterns and velocities across the aircraft's
              surface. Post-processing tools in Ansys facilitate the extraction
              of key velocity data points. These velocity data points play a
              crucial role in evaluating the aircraft's performance and guiding
              optimization efforts. Ultimately, Ansys provides a robust toolkit
              for accurately estimating airflow velocity, thereby enhancing the
              design and aerodynamic efficiency of RC aircraft.

            <p class="description">
              The Smart Dustbin project integrates ESP32 Wi-Fi Module and
              Ultrasonic Sensors to revolutionize waste management practices. By
              leveraging IoT technology, the system enables real-time monitoring
              and efficient management of dustbins. Ultrasonic sensors
              accurately measure the fill levels of the bins, transmitting data
              via the ESP32 module to a centralized system. This connectivity
              allows operators to remotely monitor fill levels, optimize
              collection routes, and schedule timely pickups. Automatic alerts
              notify maintenance teams when bins require emptying, ensuring
              proactive servicing. The project not only enhances operational
              efficiency but also promotes sustainability by reducing
              unnecessary waste collection trips and optimizing resource usage.
              Overall, the Smart Dustbin project exemplifies the fusion of IoT
              innovation with practical waste management solutions to create
              cleaner, smarter cities.

            <p class="project-title"><strong>Animal Tracking System</strong></p>
            <p class="description">
              The Animal Tracking System harnesses the power of Arduino
              microcontrollers, GPS technology, and the SIM800L GSM module to
              monitor and track animals in real-time. This innovative system
              offers a reliable solution for wildlife conservation and livestock
              management. Equipped with GPS, the system accurately pinpoints the
              location of animals, allowing researchers, conservationists, and
              farmers to monitor their movements and habitats remotely. The
              SIM800L GSM module enables seamless communication over GSM
              networks, transmitting location data to a centralized server or
              mobile application. This connectivity ensures real-time updates on
              animal whereabouts and enables proactive measures in case of
              emergencies or incidents. The system is designed for durability
              and efficiency in diverse environments, providing robust tracking
              capabilities even in remote or rugged terrain. By facilitating
              precise tracking and monitoring, the Animal Tracking System
              supports conservation efforts, enhances livestock management
              practices, and contributes to the sustainable use of natural
              resources.

              I am thrilled to share an incredible journey I undertook alongside
              my teammates Abhik L Salian and Mayur Poojary. We had the honor of
              representing St Joseph Engineering College, Mangaluru, in the
              national finals of the prestigious Boeing National Aeromodelling
              Competition, which brings together the nation’s best teams to
              compete for the ultimate glory.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our journey began with a triumphant victory at the zonal round
              held at IIT Bombay, where we secured first place. This achievement
              qualified us for the national finals, which took place on May 3,
              2024, at the SJBIT Bengaluru Grounds. The event was hosted by RV
              College Of Engineering and organized and sponsored by Boeing.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a key member of our team, I was responsible for the design and
              fabrication of our aircraft. My work focused on the intricate
              design and fabrication of the wing using balsa wood. This hands-on
              experience was incredibly valuable and rewarding, allowing me to
              apply my skills in a real-world scenario and see our efforts take
              flight.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although we did not secure a podium position in the national
              finals, the competition was a remarkable learning experience. We
              gained invaluable insights and knowledge that will undoubtedly
              benefit us in our future endeavors.
